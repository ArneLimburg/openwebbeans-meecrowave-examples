== Trivial REST Example (rewritten in Kotlin)

This example shows probably the smallest JavaEE REST Service.
It is the REST version of the famous 'Hello World' program.
It contains just a link:src/main/kotlin/com/superbiz/jaxrs/HelloEndpoint.kt[Hello Resource].
The important part of this class are the `@Path("helloKotlin")` and the `@GET' annotated method.

Note that the Resource is a CDI bean annotated with `@ApplicationScoped`.
Thus only one instance exists.
